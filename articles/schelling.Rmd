The Schelling model of segregation [@schelling1971segregation] is a famous agent-based model and it is also one of the first that got a lot of attention.
It addresses the tendency of ethnic segregation in urban areas.

The model yielded some pretty surprising results and they will make clear what the intent of an agent-based model is.

The constituents of the model are:

* a "world" which is just a square grid (think chess board)
* agents of two different kinds (let's call them blue and orange agents)
* rules of how to displace agents (they "move to a different neighborhood" if they don't feel comfortable)

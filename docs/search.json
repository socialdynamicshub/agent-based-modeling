Let’ start with something small, say 20x20:\n\n\n\nWhite cells are dead and black cells are alive.\nWe will now update the automaton one step at a time according to the following rules (Gardner 1970):\nSurvivals: Each alive cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives into the next generation.\nDeaths: Each alive cell that has less than 2 neighbors dies from isolation. Each alive cell with 4 or more neighbors dies from overpopulation.\nBirths: Each dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive.\nIf we talk about neighbors, we are referring to the Moore neighborhood. Note that we apply these rules to all cells simultaneously.\nSo far so good. Seems innoccuous, right?\nTask\nWhat would you expect to happen when we play this setup out over many generations?\nIn fact, this cellular automaton, called Life, displays some very complex dynamics, and, frankly, some really fancy ones.\nLet’s have a look at how the initial state shown above would play out.\n\n\n\nYou can see that there are some pulsing things, some moving things, and many more interesting emergent patterns.\nTo this day, people are hunting for these patterns. There is already a rich library of regularities and classifications on Life, some of which we will have a look at.\nGlider\nThe glider is perhaps the most infamous structure in life.\nIt looks like this:\n\n\n\nTODO:\ngliders and spaceships, oscillators, still lifes\na bit of history\nintuitive notion of emergence\nProject\nImplement Life in Julia.\n\n\n\nGardner, M. 1970. “Mathematical Games: The Fantastic Combinations of John Conway’s New Solitaire Game \"life\".” Scientific American 223 (4): 120–23.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nCellular automata usually operate on lattices and they perform local computations, meaning that the state of a cell depends on the cell’s immediate vicinity and not some global state. This means that we need some definitions of what constitutes a neighborhood in cellular automata. But the concept of neighborhoods extends to agent-based models as well.\nMoore Neighborhood\nPerhaps the most common neighborhood relation is the Moore neighborhood. It is used, for instance, in Conway’s life.\nThe Moore neighborhood is defined on a two-dimensional lattice, or simply but, a grid. This is what it looks like:\n[GRAPHIC MOORE NEIGHBORHOOD]\nThe Moore neighborhood is simply given by the four cells on each side of a cell as well as the four cells on each corner of a cell (think north, north-east, east, south-east, etc.).\nYou might say “Well of course all 8 adjacent cells are the neighborhood of a cell! What else could it be?” Well, there is one obvious other way.\nVon Neumann Neighborhood\nThe Von Neumann neighborhood is also defined on a lattice (although it is more generic and applies not only to two-dimensional grids, more on that further down). On a two-dimensional lattice, it’s simply the four cells that are adjacent to each side of a cell.\n[GRAPHIC VON NEUMANN NEIGHBORHOOD]\nThe more formal definition, however, is that the Von Neumann neighborhood is comprised of the cell in question and all cells within a Manhattan distance of 1.\nNeighborhoods in Graphs\nIn a graph, the definition for neighborhood is pretty straight-forward. In the simplest case, it is just all nodes that are connected to a node by an edge. Of course, you can also define neighborhoods with larger distances, for example all nodes that are within a path distance of 2 of a node.\n[GRAPHIC OF GRAPH NEIGHBORHOOD]\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe Schelling model of segregation (Schelling 1971) is a famous agent-based model (ABM) and it is one of the first that got a lot of attention. It addresses the tendency of ethnic segregation in urban areas.\nThe model yielded some pretty surprising results and they will make clear what the intent of an agent-based model is.\nThe constituents of the model are:\nAn Environment\nThe environment is the “arena” in which the agents interact with one another. In the Schelling model, we use a square grid:\n\n\n\nAgents\nThe agents are the individuals that interact in the arena. In this case, we have two different kinds of agents that we distribute across the grid. Let’s call them blue and orange agents. Note that we don’t fill the grid completely, there are empty cells left.\n\n\n\nAdditionally to having a position in the environment, agents can have states or attributes. Here each agents is either happy or unhappy.\nRules\nThe rules define how agents interact with one another as well as with the environment. In the Schelling model, the rules are as follows:\nThere is a global tolerance level which indicates, how many agents of the same kind any agent wishes to live next to.\nIf the number of neighbors of the other kind (i.e., blue if an agent is orange and vice versa) is higher than the tolerance level allows, an agent is unhappy, otherwise it is happy.\nThe model is played in iterations (sometimes called steps, ticks, time steps, …). In each iteration, each agent’s mood is determined (happy or unhappy). Agents that are unhappy move to a random free cell.\nEnvironment, agents, and rules are the three essential ingredients for any ABM.\nThe neighborhood is defined as the eight cells around the cell that an agents sits on (the Moore neighborhood). [TODO: add link once article done]\n[GRAPHIC FOR NEIGHBORHOOD]\nRunning the Model\nNow that we have the setup down, let’s look at a simple example. We randomly draw distribute 40% blue agents, 40% orange agents, and 20% free cells over the board. The tolerance level is set to 3, meaning that each agent prefers 4 or more agents of its own kind in its neighborhood. This is what happens:\n\n\n\nTask\nThere is a free implementation of Schelling’s model of segregation (Wilensky 1997) in the NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) library. Open it and play around with the parameters. Can you observe some general tendencies of what happens?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchelling, Thomas C. 1971. “Dynamic Models of Segregation.” The Journal of Mathematical Sociology 1 (2): 143–86. https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794.\n\n\nWilensky, U. 1997. “NetLogo Segregation Model.” Evanston, IL: Center for Connected Learning; Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Segregation.\n\n\n———. 1999. “NetLogo.” Evanston, IL: Center for Connected Learning; Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/.\n\n\n\n\n",

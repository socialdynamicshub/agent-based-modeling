Let’s break it down and start with emergence.\nIt’s a concept that is a bit hard to explain, but cellular automata serve as a great example because they make it intuitively understandable.\n\n\n\n",

Randomly assign each cell one of two states: alive or dead.\nThis is what we have so far:\n\n\n\nWe will now update the automaton one step at a time according to the following rules (Gardner 1970):\nSurvivals: Each alive cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives into the next generation.\nDeaths: Each alive cell that has less than 2 neighbors dies from isolation. Each alive cell with 4 or more neighbors dies from overpopulation.\nBirths: Each dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive.\nIf we talk about neighbors, we are referring to the Moore neighborhood.\nSo far so good. Seems innoccuous, right?\nTask\nWhat would you expect to happen when we play this setup out over many generations?\nIn fact, this cellular automaton, called Life, displays some very complex dynamics, and, frankly, some really fancy ones.\nLet’s have a look at an example.\n[ANIMATION OF LIFE]\nProject\nImplement Life in Julia.\n\n\n\nGardner, M. 1970. “Mathematical Games: The Fantastic Combinations of John Conway’s New Solitaire Game \"life\".” Scientific American 223 (4): 120–23.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe Schelling model of segregation (Schelling 1971) is a famous agent-based model (ABM) and it is also one of the first that got a lot of attention. It addresses the tendency of ethnic segregation in urban areas.\nThe model yielded some pretty surprising results and they will make clear what the intent of an agent-based model is.\nThe constituents of the model are:\na “world” which is just a square grid (think chess board)\nagents of two different kinds (let’s call them blue and orange agents)\nrules of how to displace agents (they “move to a different neighborhood” if they don’t feel comfortable)\nThese are, coincidentally (although, of course, not so much so), the three fundamental ingredients of agent-based models in general.\n[GRAPHIC OF SETUP]\nThe world and the agents are relatively self-explanatory, but what about the rules?\nRules in an ABM determine how agents interact with other agents or their environment. They define the “behavior” of the agents, if you will.\nIn the Schelling model, agents have an attribute: They are either happy or unhappy. What determines their happiness is a global “tolerance” threshold which determines how many agents of the other kind they tolerate in their neighborhood (i.e., if they are blue agents, how many orange agents they accept to live next to). The neighborhood is defined as the eight cells around the cell that an agents sits on.\n[GRAPHIC FOR NEIGHBORHOOD]\nTask\nThere is a free implementation of Schelling’s model of segregation (Wilensky 1997) in the netlogo (Wilensky 1999) library. Open it and play around with the parameters. Can you observe some general tendencies of what happens?\n\n\n\nSchelling, Thomas C. 1971. “Dynamic Models of Segregation.” The Journal of Mathematical Sociology 1 (2): 143–86. https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794.\n\n\nWilensky, U. 1997. “NetLogo Segregation Model.” Evanston, IL: Center for Connected Learning; Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Segregation.\n\n\n———. 1999. “NetLogo.” Evanston, IL: Center for Connected Learning; Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/.\n\n\n\n\n",

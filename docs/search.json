      "contents": "\nThe Schelling model of segregation (Schelling 1971) is a famous agent-based model and it is also one of the first that got a lot of attention. It addresses the tendency of ethnic segregation in urban areas.\nThe model yielded some pretty surprising results and they will make clear what the intent of an agent-based model is.\nThe constituents of the model are:\na “world” which is just a square grid (think chess board)\nagents of two different kinds (let’s call them blue and orange agents)\nrules of how to displace agents (they “move to a different neighborhood” if they don’t feel comfortable)\n\n\n\nSchelling, Thomas C. 1971. “Dynamic Models of Segregation.” The Journal of Mathematical Sociology 1 (2): 143–86. https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794.\n\n\n\n\n",

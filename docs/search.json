Let’ start with something small, say 20x20:\n\n\n\nWhite cells are dead and black cells are alive.\nWe will now update the automaton one step at a time according to the following rules (Gardner 1970):\nSurvivals: Each alive cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives into the next generation.\nDeaths: Each alive cell that has less than 2 neighbors dies from isolation. Each alive cell with 4 or more neighbors dies from overpopulation.\nBirths: Each dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes alive.\nIf we talk about neighbors, we are referring to the Moore neighborhood. Note that we apply these rules to all cells simultaneously.\nSo far so good. Seems innoccuous, right?\nTask\nWhat would you expect to happen when we play this setup out over many generations?\nIn fact, this cellular automaton, called Life, displays some very complex dynamics, and, frankly, some really fancy ones.\nLet’s have a look at how the initial state shown above would play out.\n\n\n\nYou can see that there are some pulsing things, some moving things, and many more interesting emergent patterns.\nTo this day, people are hunting for these patterns. There is already a rich library of regularities and classifications on Life, some of which we will have a look at.\nGlider\nThe glider is perhaps the most infamous structure in life.\nIt looks like this:\n\n\n\nTODO:\ngliders and spaceships, oscillators, still lifes\na bit of history\nintuitive notion of emergence\nProject\nImplement Life in Julia.\n\n\n\nGardner, M. 1970. “Mathematical Games: The Fantastic Combinations of John Conway’s New Solitaire Game \"life\".” Scientific American 223 (4): 120–23.\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nCellular automata usually operate on lattices and they perform local computations, meaning that the state of a cell depends on the cell’s immediate vicinity and not some global state. This means that we need some definitions of what constitutes a neighborhood in cellular automata. But the concept of neighborhoods extends to agent-based models as well.\nMoore Neighborhood\nPerhaps the most common neighborhood relation is the Moore neighborhood. It is used, for instance, in Conway’s life.\nThe Moore neighborhood is defined on a two-dimensional lattice, or simply but, a grid. This is what it looks like:\n[GRAPHIC MOORE NEIGHBORHOOD]\nThe Moore neighborhood is simply given by the four cells on each side of a cell as well as the four cells on each corner of a cell (think north, north-east, east, south-east, etc.).\nYou might say “Well of course all 8 adjacent cells are the neighborhood of a cell! What else could it be?” Well, there is one obvious other way.\nVon Neumann Neighborhood\nThe Von Neumann neighborhood is also defined on a lattice (although it is more generic and applies not only to two-dimensional grids, more on that further down). On a two-dimensional lattice, it’s simply the four cells that are adjacent to each side of a cell.\n[GRAPHIC VON NEUMANN NEIGHBORHOOD]\nThe more formal definition, however, is that the Von Neumann neighborhood is comprised of the cell in question and all cells within a Manhattan distance of 1.\nNeighborhoods in Graphs\nIn a graph, the definition for neighborhood is pretty straight-forward. In the simplest case, it is just all nodes that are connected to a node by an edge. Of course, you can also define neighborhoods with larger distances, for example all nodes that are within a path distance of 2 of a node.\n[GRAPHIC OF GRAPH NEIGHBORHOOD]\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe Schelling model of segregation (Schelling 1971) is a famous agent-based model (ABM) and it is also one of the first that got a lot of attention. It addresses the tendency of ethnic segregation in urban areas.\nThe model yielded some pretty surprising results and they will make clear what the intent of an agent-based model is.\nThe constituents of the model are:\na “world” which is just a square grid (think chess board)\nagents of two different kinds (let’s call them blue and orange agents)\nrules of how to displace agents (they “move to a different neighborhood” if they don’t feel comfortable)\nThese are, coincidentally (although, of course, not so much so), the three fundamental ingredients of agent-based models in general.\n\n\n\nThe world and the agents are relatively self-explanatory, but what about the rules?\nRules in an ABM determine how agents interact with other agents or their environment. They define the “behavior” of the agents, if you will.\nIn the Schelling model, agents have an attribute: They are either happy or unhappy. What determines their happiness is a global “tolerance” threshold which determines how many agents of the other kind they tolerate in their neighborhood (i.e., if they are blue agents, how many orange agents they accept to live next to). The neighborhood is defined as the eight cells around the cell that an agents sits on (the Moore neighborhood). [TODO: add link once article done]\n[GRAPHIC FOR NEIGHBORHOOD]\nTask\nThere is a free implementation of Schelling’s model of segregation (Wilensky 1997) in the NetLogo (Wilensky 1999) library. Open it and play around with the parameters. Can you observe some general tendencies of what happens?\n\n\n\nSchelling, Thomas C. 1971. “Dynamic Models of Segregation.” The Journal of Mathematical Sociology 1 (2): 143–86. https://doi.org/10.1080/0022250X.1971.9989794.\n\n\nWilensky, U. 1997. “NetLogo Segregation Model.” Evanston, IL: Center for Connected Learning; Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Segregation.\n\n\n———. 1999. “NetLogo.” Evanston, IL: Center for Connected Learning; Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/.\n\n\n\n\n",
